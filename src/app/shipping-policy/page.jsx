                  We can ship tangible products available on the website almost
                  anywhere in India other than a few locations, which our
                  logistic partners do not serve. When you place an order, we
                  will estimate delivery dates based upon the availability of
                  your item(s) and your shipment's destination. The estimated
                  delivery dates may however differ from actual delivery dates
                  and a failure to comply with the estimated delivery date will
                  not give rise to any cause of action against us. We usually
                  get your shipment delivered within 3 - 15 business days of
                  your placing the order on our website depending on the
                  location.

                  If there is any further delay in shipping the products, one of
                  our customer support executives will contact you regarding the
                  same.

                  We use high quality corrugated shipping box to reduce transit
                  breakage and pilferage. Our courier partner captures
                  non-delivered items information in real time and tries to
                  deliver the next day.

                  Shipping charges will be calculated based on the location and
                  weight of the products. Even though we try our best to ensure
                  on-time delivery, there are certain conditions under which the
                  delivery may get delayed:
